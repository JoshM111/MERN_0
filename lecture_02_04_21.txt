next week we will be going over express and mongo

get thru pokemon api by monday
ternary operators

try to do the lukeapiwalker if you can. if you can accomplish this assignment you will be able to do the front end portion of the exam

libraries
ones that we have used
useEffect
    can go out and run with fetch- once
        used to run code that is asynchornus
            or needs to be run once

today we will be using the poke api

bootstrap
    how to add
    npm install bootstrap

in certain scenarios you will need a value in the [] at the end of a useEffect function

axios-
using regular js


import axios from 'axios';

useEffect(() => {
    axios.get("link" + pokemonCount)
        .then(response) => {
            console.log(response);
            setPokemon(response.results);

        }
}    )

this can change the format in which your code is going to be run. make sure that you are routing correctly if you are updating code that has already been written.

Reach router;
import { Router } from '@reach/router';

Link-
import { Link } from '@reach/router';

const Header = () => {
    return(
        <div>
            <Links
    )
}
