= Vs == VS === in JavaScript

=,

= in JavaScript is used for assigning values to a variable.
It is called as assignment operator
The assignment operator can evaluate to the assigned value
It does not return true or false
= simply assign one value of variable to another one.
== will not compare the value of variables at all.

==,
== in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable.
It is called as comparison operator
Checks the equality of two operands without considering their type.
Return true if the two operands are equal. It will return false if the two operands are not equal.
== make type correction based upon values of variables
 of variables at all.	The == checks for equality only after doing necessary conversations.

===,
=== is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
It is also called as comparison operator
Compares equality of two operands with their types
It returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.
=== takes type of variable in consideration.
If two variable values are not similar, then === will not perform any conversion.



KEY DIFFERENCES:
= is used for assigning values to a variable, == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable whereas === is used for comparing two variables,
 but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
= is called as assignment operator, == is called as comparison operator whereas It is also called as comparison operator.
= does not return true or false, == Return true only if the two operands are equal while === returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.

Arrouw Functions
=> is like saying return this
you may not have to write return but if you want the function to log something or do something other than return the value you 
need to implicitly write it as return " this " 
ex. const square = n => console.log(n*n);
